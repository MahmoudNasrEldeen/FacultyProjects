- Problem Overview ...?
Predict the rate of the product in Apple Store which is
high, intermediate or low

- Dataset ...?
about 4798 Record data(2800) have (12)features as:
id, track_name, size_bytes, currency, price, rating_count_tot,
rating_count_ver, vpp_lic, ver, cont_rating, prime_genre,
sup_devices.num, ipadSc_urls.num, lang.num
and the output variable is the rate of track

- Preprocessing ...?
1- Read the data
2- Fix Nan Values
   - Remove Records that have 8 Empty Values
   - Get Categorical and Numerical Features from dataset
   - in Categorical Feat replace null values with mod value
   - in Numerical Feat Replace null values with mean
3- Convert Categorical Features To Numerical Features using LabelEncoder()
4- Make Dummy Variables using OneHotEncoder()
5- Feature Selection based on 0.02 Percentage
6- Making Comparison before and after feature selection
   To make sure that feature selected is trustful
7- Split data into training and testing
8- Feature Scaling using StanderScaler()

- Training and Testing ...?
train the problems using 3 different Classification algorithms like
SVM(Support Vector Machine), RFC(Random Forest Classifier) and
KNN(K Nearest Neighbor) then pickle the model in file then
in testing load the model to re-run for new data
